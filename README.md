<h4 align="center">A collection of code challenges and computer science topics.</h4>
<br>

## Purpose

1. [Code Challenges](src/code-challenges/) from Codewars. <img src="https://www.codewars.com/users/maltewirz/badges/micro" alt="Codewars profile tag" />
2. [Algorithms](src/computer-science/algorithms/) for searching and sorting.
3. [Data Structures](src/computer-science/data-structures/) like Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Heaps and Trees.
4. [Solving patterns](src/computer-science/solving-patterns/) like Divide and Conquer, Multiple Pointers and Frequency Counter.

## Built With

- All code is written using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- The Typescript tests are written with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) for unit testing.

## Getting Started 

1. Fork or clone this repository to your local machine.

### For Typescript Challenges

2. Install using `npm i` command in your terminal.

3. Run `npm run test <filename>` for a specific test, or `npm run test` to run all tests.

### For Python Challenges

2. Install using `pipenv install` command in your terminal.

3. Start a shell environment by running pipenv shell

4. Navigate into any directory and run files using the `python <filename>` command. 

4.1 Alternative for automatically rerun tests: `nodemon --ext py --exec "python src/code-challenges/xx/test_xx.py"`
