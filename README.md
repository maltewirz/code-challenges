# Coding Practice

## A collection of code challenges and computer science topics

## Purpose

* [Clean Code](src/clean-code/) notes, examples and checklist.
* [Algorithms](src/computer-science/algorithms/) for searching and sorting.
* [Data Structures](src/computer-science/data-structures/) like Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Heaps and Trees.
* [Solving patterns](src/computer-science/solving-patterns/) like Divide and Conquer, Multiple Pointers and Frequency Counter.
* [Codewars Code Challenges](src/code-challenges/) <img src="https://www.codewars.com/users/maltewirz/badges/micro" alt="Codewars profile tag" />
* [Leetcode Code Challenges](src/leetcode/)

## Built With

* The code is written using Javascript, Typescript and Python.
* The Typescript tests are written with Jest for unit testing.

## Getting Started

### For Typescript Challenges

1. Install using `npm i` command in your terminal.

2. Run `npm run test-ts <filename>` for a specific test, or `npm run test-ts` to run all tests.

### For Python Challenges

1. Install using `pipenv install` command in your terminal.

2. Start a shell environment by running pipenv shell

3. Navigate into any directory and run files using the `python <filename>` command.

4. Alternative for automatically rerun tests: Install nodemon globally: `npm i -g nodemon` and then run `KYU=<kyu> FOLDER=<folder> KATA=<kata> npm run test-py`. The first three variables (e.g. `KYU=6KYU FOLDER=arrayDiff KATA=array_diff`) define which test to run.
