# There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except
#  for one. Try to find it!

# find_uniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) == 2
# find_uniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) == 0.55
# Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

# The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

# This is the first kata in series:

# Find the unique number (this kata)
# Find the unique string
# Find The Unique


def find_uniq(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 2):
        if arr[i] == arr[i + 1] == arr[i + 2]:
            continue
        elif arr[i] != arr[i + 1] == arr[i + 2]:

# def find_uniq(arr):
#     a, b = set(arr)
#     return a if arr.count(a) == 1 else b
