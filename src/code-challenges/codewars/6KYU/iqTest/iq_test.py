# Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test
#  is to find out which one of the given numbers differs from the others.
#  Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in evenness.
#  Help Bob â€” to check his answers, he needs a program that among the given
#  numbers finds one that is different in evenness, and return a position
#  of this number.

# ! Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test, which
#  means indexes of the elements start from 1 (not 0)

# ##Examples :

# iq_test("2 4 7 8 10") => 3 // Third number is odd, while the rest of
#  the numbers are even

# iq_test("1 2 1 1") => 2 // Second number is even, while the rest of
#  the numbers are odd


def iq_test(numbers):
    arr = [int(x) for x in numbers.split()]
    even = [x for x in arr if x % 2 == 0]
    odd = [x for x in arr if x % 2 != 0]
    if len(odd) > len(even):
        return arr.index(even[0]) + 1
    else:
        return arr.index(odd[0]) + 1

# Alternative

# def iq_test(n):
#     n = [int(i)%2 for i in n.split()]
#     if n.count(0)>1:
#         return n.index(1)+1
#     else:
#         return n.index(0)+1
