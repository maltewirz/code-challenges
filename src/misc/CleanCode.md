# Clean Code

### Clean Code Definitions: 

* Easy to read and understand.
* Should reduce cognitive load
* Should be concise and "to the point"
* Should avoid unintuitive names, complex nesting and big code blocks.
* Should follow common best practices and patterns.
* Should be fun to write and to maintain.

Story writing: Code is like an essay, you are the author. Make it fun and easy to read and understand.

### Key pain points

* Names
  * Variables
  * Functions
  * Classes
* Structure & Comments
  * Code Formatting
  * Good and Bad Comments
* Functions
  * Length
  * Parameters
* Conditionals & Error Handling
  * Deep Nesting
  * Missing Error Handling
* Classes & Data Structures
  * Missing Distinction
  * Bloated Classes

### Solutions:

	* Rules and Concepts
	* Patterns & Principles
	* Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### Distinctions

* Clean Code: Readable + easy to understand.
* Patterns and Principles: Maintainable and extensible.
* Clean Architecture:  Where to write which code. Focus on project as a whole.

### How to write Clean Code

* After each Feature, do a refactor (adjust functions, rename variables).
* Refactoring today is work you save tomorrow.
* A codebase can only survive and stay maintable if its continuosly imporved and refactored
* Pro tip: Whenever you add something new, try to improve existing code along the way.
